Introduction
Skool Bag is a basic math calculator that will be designed to solve the standard math problems for the secondary school students. It will be designed in a way that it will cover major topics of the books from 6-8 standards in the first phase. After the first phase, 9-10 standard books will be taken into consideration and hence phase 2 will end here. This software will ease the tasks of students who faces problem in their studies and cannot find the answers on their own. 
The main motive of Skool Bag is to minimize the work done by a student to solve a problem which he/she could not do because of some specific reasons. A student just have to enter the values given in the question and the software will do the rest of the work.
This software will be hosted from GoDaddy and Hostgator , hence it will be easier for someone to access this anytime.
